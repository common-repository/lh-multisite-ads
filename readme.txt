== Description ==

LH Multisite Ads allow you to automatically insert ads after paragraphs of your post content throughout your multisite network. This saves you the hassle of manually entering ads in each of your post, or installing a plugin on each inidivual site. This plugin is a for of the original <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-post-ads/" title="WordPress Insert Post Ads" rel="friend">WordPress Insert Post Ads</a> plugin, but was forked to allow ads to be added in one place and displayed throughout the network.
